Download all files into the same directory.

On the command line, run the run_me.py:
> python run_me.py

To change the directions-x.txt, open run_me.py and uncomment the code for the direction file that you want to run. Run only one directions-x.txt at a time.

Here is the snippet of code from run_me.py:

if __name__ == '__main__':

    # Uncomment to run the direction file. The files
    # must be located in the same directory as
    # run_me.py. Run only one direction at a time.
    #
    #start('directions-1.txt')
    #start('directions-2.txt')
    start('directions-3.txt')
    #start('directions-4.txt')
    #start('directions-5.txt')
    #start('directions-6.txt')
